# <pwd-memory>
The pwd-memory is a simple Memory game, intended for being used within the pwd-application component. Instructions on how to install the pwd-memory app can be found in the README.md file of pwd-application.
When starting the app, the player is asked to enter a nickname of at least three characters, and choose a game difficulty. The game will keep track of how many mistakes the player makes, as well as the time taken to find all card pairs.
High Score lists are different depending on the difficulty level of the game, and results will first be ordered by number of mistakes, then time taken to finish.
